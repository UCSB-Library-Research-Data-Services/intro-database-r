[Research Data Services (RDS)](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/research-data-services) helps UCSB researchers manage and preserve their research data through:

-   Consultations
-   Long-term engagements
-   Instructional workshops

Our team offers support across the research data lifecycle, from pre-project planning to post-project archival, connecting researchers with both locally- and externally-provided curation services. Our goal is to ensure that all research data is well-described, FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), and sustainably preservable, and that researchers receive scholarly credit for sharing and publishing data.
