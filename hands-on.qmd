title: "Hands-on DuckDB & dplyr"
---

## Let's connect to our first database

Loading the necessary packages. DuckDB has its own R package that is mostly a wrapper around dbplyr

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# install.packages("duckdb")
library(duckdb) 
```


Create an empty database and save it to disk

```{r}
con <- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), dbdir = "birds.duckdb", read_only = FALSE)
```
