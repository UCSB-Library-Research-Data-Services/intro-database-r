Summary: In this workshop, we will discuss why you might consider a relational database to store environmental data. We will go over how to insert data in and retrieve data from a database using R and duckDB. We will focus on how to use the R dbplyr package to integrate databases into tidyverse-focused analytical workflows.

This workshop will cover these main points:  

- Introduce concepts of a database and discuss why you might want to have/want to use one
- How to integrate the use of a database into an R analytical workflow
- Hands-on exercise using duckDB, dbplyr and how it can be used to learn some SQL basics
