STUDY DESCRIPTION

ARCTIC SHOREBIRD DEMOGRAPHICS NETWORK  https://doi.org/10.18739/A2222R68W

Dataset hosted by the NSF Arctic Data Center (https://arcticdata.io)

Field data on shorebird ecology and environmental conditions were collected from 1993-2014 at 16 field sites in Alaska, Canada, and Russia.  Data were not collected in every year at all sites. Studies of the population ecology of these birds included nest-monitoring to determine timing of reproduction and reproductive success; live capture of birds to collect blood samples, feathers, and fecal samples for investigations of population structure and pathogens; banding of birds to determine annual survival rates; resighting of color-banded birds to determine space use and site fidelity; and use of light-sensitive geolocators to investigate migratory movements. Data on climatic conditions, prey abundance, and predators were also collected. Environmental data included weather stations that recorded daily climatic conditions, surveys of seasonal snowmelt, weekly sampling of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates that are prey of shorebirds, live trapping of small mammals (alternate prey for shorebird predators), and daily counts of potential predators (jaegers, falcons, foxes). Detailed field methods for each year are available in the ASDN_protocol_201X.pdf files.  All research was conducted under permits from relevant federal, state and university authorities. 

Potential users of these data should first contact the relevant data author(s), listed below.  This will enable coordination in terms of updates/corrections to the data and ongoing analyses.  Key analyses of the data are in progress and will be included in the theses and dissertations of graduate students who collected these field data.

SPECIES NAMES

Bird species names are abbreviated with lowercase US Bird Banding Lab four-letter codes in all 
data files.  Mammal species names are likewise abbreviated following the same scheme.  This
list defines the four-letter abbreviations used in the data files. "Study species" are 
included in the datasets for banding, resighting, and/or nest monitoring.

ASDN SITE INFO

ASDN field sites are referred to by 4-letter codes in each of the data files.  General information on each site is given here.  Not all types of data are available for every site.

*** MEDS 213: data has been moved to site.csv. ***


------------------------

COLOR BAND CODES

Shorebirds were banded with unique combinations of color bands.  In the data files, the following
abbreviations are used to indicate each color.  Color band combinations are indicated for each part of each leg.	
Colors on the same part of the leg are separated by commas (e.g. "m,y").

DATA FILES

In all data fields, a blank or "-" indicates absence of data. In some cases, this means no data were recorded; in other cases, it may be that the data were not transferred to the ASDN database by the site PI. For example, a blank in a blood sample column does not guarantee that no blood sample was taken from that individual. Contact site PIs to determine when the relevant data were collected versus not collected, if relevant to your study.
